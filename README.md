# From-CC50
Just some of the projects created during the CS-50 classes
I started watching the classes translated into Portuguese and thought it would be a good idea
to document all the progress I'm making.

Starting with the C language, 
which I had little or no knowledge about, 
I consider myself taking small steps as a child in programming 
And I aim to surpass my own levels of knowledge.

So if you are just starting out like me 
and want to enjoy me on this long journey in programming, follow me

Feel free to correct me or comment on my codes, 
ask me questions or even help me with project ideas.

SEEYA! :)
